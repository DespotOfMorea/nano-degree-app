This app is based on Sunshine weather app ([repo](https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Sunshine)) that students build during the [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851) course at Udacity.

It uses [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/), a free, open-source API for generating random user data. Like Lorem Ipsum, but for people.

On [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) you can find a collective list of free APIs for use in software and web development.
